Music can be a great driving force, for when I need to get something done, but lack the focus/energy to do it. However, this music has to pretty closely match my mood to interfere constructively. So, I've been making playlists for different moods! I've been aggregating these over the past couple months. I've tried to showcase a variety so y'all can discover new folks.
Each playlist starts at a given energy level and, in order, will gradually transition to a higher one. If you lined each one up, starting from ***Ambient Silence*** and going to ***Ill Advised***, it should be a smooth listening experience. Here's them in order:

[Audible Silence](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvqb3LL57WHjJSt6Uv1qViVfQYmnK4DKi&si=4j9TvDxDSkE6cen1): For when you need sound, but nothing else. Minimal distraction, like a musical white noise. 
[Focus Focus](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvqb3LL57WHifwinrMmTLeSEBiojqs5d1&si=1QJOaRRMIPxu1RwK): Least specific, most genre spanning. Medium/slow bpm, mix of flowy synths and beat heavy tracks. Great for getting started.
[Beats](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvqb3LL57WHhZEPYm0ynQug5vVsHaMSim&si=1QDufOkayCXeWCb9): Medium/fast bpm with rhythmic, solid beats. Not as cerebral, but good for working late and building a consistent energy.
[Ill Advised](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvqb3LL57WHgPRpIRn51vY6Jy-AkDz7X5&si=Vz8LzsWfqXr1_1BH): Some are as fast as is manageable, for finishing projects before midnight deadlines. Others are just weird/disruptive - great for disrupting linear thinking.
