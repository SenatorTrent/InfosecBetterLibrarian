Here's a collect of information security related books, all from No Starch Press, a great publisher for readable and technical computer stuff, as well as other subjects. Under each title is a short description of what you can find in the book, in terms of both concepts covered and tools used, environments, and what I think about the quality. 

#### **WARNING:** 
Some terrible knave is hosting the (highly readable!) pdfs for all of these books [at this link!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b2XPoTK8wn6sHALhySSM3TTaFnTIExY4) I wanted to warn you, so you don't accidentally ==*download these great resources for free!*== Be careful out there.

### Bug Bounty Bootcamp:
This is an intro to bug hunting, from finding bug-bounty programs to actually searching for and disclosing exploits. Covers setting up a testing environment, using Burpsuite, and more. Has whole chapters on specific types of exploits with detailed tips and examples. 
### Black Hat Python
About writing your own offensive tools in python. Doing things like networking, windows privilege escalation, interacting with burpsuite, with python.. Covers basic python setup, libraries including scapy (great networking lib to know) and socket, among others. I think the code could be better explained, but still a good resource. 

### Hacking: The Art of Explotation (2nd edition)
Seems to be a popular infosec book, at least for older school folks. If memory serves, this book isn't about modern techniques like the others here, but older hacks and general concepts of exploiting computers. Comes with a liveCD enviornment setup to run code in. Looks like a good foundational book.

### The Hardware Hacking Handbook
A different type of computer security for most of us, working with actual bare metal. An intro to the electrical part of computers and hardware hacking. Covers component identification (reverse engineering), fault injection, memory dumping, and power analysis, in detail. Messing with circuitry and understanding it.

### Metasploit (The Pen. Tester's Guide)
Intro to advanced coverage of Metasploit, a popular pen testing framework. I haven't used Metasploit (at time of writing) but this guide seems to give full coverage of it, and meterpreter (a post exploit tool for metasploit). Covers the exploits themselves too.

### Practical Malware Analysis
A book about *analyzing* (Not creating, I checked) malware. Includes static (not running the malware) and dynamic (*running the malware*) modes of analysis, as well as making a VM for testing. Great defensive malware resource.

### Rootkits and Bootkits
Another defensive book, on defending against and reverse engineering root and boot kits. *Not* a guide for writing your own, though. Uses malware as case studies.

### Serious Cryptography
An intro to modern encryption that starts with the Caesar cipher, ending at post-quantum. There's a whole chapter on randomness! Covers the abstract math, uses python for code.

### Designing Secure Software (A guide for developers)
What it says on the tin? I haven't had time to review this one in depth. If you do, let me know, and I'll update this description. About the theory behind making secure software, and what to look out for.

### Silence on the Wire (A field guide to reconnaissance and indirect attacks)
This one, it's really weird. Different from typical technical books, in that it's less of a reference and more a story about how things work. Main focus is enigmatic data leaking attacks, but to make you understand these, the book explores many different parts of computing. I recommend it!
