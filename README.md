The toughest part of doing cool things with computers, for me, is always learning in the first place. There's a reason we call techie-savants computer wizards: there's an arcane collection of knowledge required to do it, and an almost mystic devotion needed to learn all of it. There's just so much!
This wiki serves to help with that burden: it's ideally, a guide to initiate you into the fascinating world of the electron and the switch, starting from very little. To take you to the point where you know enough to learn for yourself.
It's also a collection of insider sources, interesting projects, and free stuff. Something for the more experienced too!

Let's get started! You can browse the library on the web, but crosslinking and other stuff works better in [Obsidian]([url](https://obsidian.md/)). Then, you can [clone]([url](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone)) the library and start looking around. This [guide explains how]([url](https://dev.to/yanpi/unleash-the-power-of-obsidian-with-github-a-guide-to-organizing-your-digital-brain-38cl)) (you don't know how to do this, let the librarian know, they'll help you out).

This was started as a project for the MVHS Information Security Club.
